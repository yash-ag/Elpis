This is the codefundo++ project repo of team Alpha Q.

### Plan
We are creating an android app that helps the people in need connect to the volunteers who are ready to help people.
This app will help people estrangled to make an SOS. Their location will be automically generated and displayed in a Map through   which people can volunteer to help. The app will have two segments for volunteering and requesting help. People estrangled could request for food, water, medical attentiom and other important amneties. The volunteer work will also include donation and collection drives. 

### Working
The app takes data like loaction(automatic/manual), supplies required etc. and stores in a Table in JSON Format(Azure is used as BaaS). The collected data is then displayed systematically through which one can volunteer to help. The search function will also be implemented which will prioritize the requests and display them accordingly. User will also have an option to filter the results.

### Usability
The app will be having a simple UX through which any user can interact with the app easily. The app will be helpful in post-disaster situations. 

### Technologies used
Android Studio, Azure, Git, GitHub, Node.js, Python, Java, Kotlin
- #### Libraries used
Retrofit, Butterknife, GSON, Glide, Espresso, Picasso, Calligraphy, Timber
